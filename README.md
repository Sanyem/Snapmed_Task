# Snapmed Coding Task



## Problem Statement: 
Design a small web application for an online doctor consultation which can be used to book an appointment with doctors. Think of it this way - You onboard a doctor (along with a photo and basic details about him) and you mark their availability which will be available for patients(users) to book. Details: You need to send us a design document, your code (preferably a GitHub repo) along with a working web application on how you would implement it. It should support adding/deleting/updating the doctors as well as their availability. You are free to assume everything else but make sure you document them. Make sure you have considered things like authentication (only authenticated users can add / view / edit / delete items).
